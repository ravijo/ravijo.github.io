I am the lead engineer (robot motion) at FingerVision Inc. (a Japanese venture to expand the possibilities by enabling vision-based tactile sensing for robots).
I received Ph.D. degree from the [Kyushu Institute of Technology (Japan)](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english). 
I developed [robotic clothing assistance](https://www.ravijoshi.xyz/project/framework-robotic-clothing-assistance-imitation-learning) (a robotic system to assist the elderly in getting them dressed up) during my Ph.D.
